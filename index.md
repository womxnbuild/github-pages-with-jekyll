Welcome to my first blog post. I plan to talk about how I set up GH pages using GitHub's tutorials. GitHub tutorials have been really easy to follow along and the tools supported to test them out online has been awesome so far. Right now, I am on GH's web editor which is basically VSCode on the web. 
- To get there from an existing repo, you go to the repo page and click `.`. Cool, right? 
- I created a branch, made changes, committed theem, and create a pull request. GitHub tutorials are bot based so they pretty much make comments like a real person and help you merge your changes!
